Akalpit and I worked closely to launch and operate the Agile Tacoma, a
professional networking and study group focused on Agile, Scrum, and Lean
topics. It was a huge win to have his participation! He has very practical
experience with executing Agile practices and he has a solid vision of how
Agile can be best leveraged in the software development environment. Akalpit
has been a key contributor when forming Agile Tacoma. He has both identified
relevant and valuable topics, has presented on several topic areas, and has
helped execute the events. We are very fortunate to have benefited from his
guidance and involvement.
